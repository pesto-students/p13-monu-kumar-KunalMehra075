#### Q1 What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

##### Answer :

A protocol stack, often referred to as a network protocol stack or simply a protocol suite, is a set of communication protocols that are layered on top of each other to enable the exchange of data and information between different software applications, devices, or systems. Each layer in the protocol stack performs a specific set of functions, and these layers work together to facilitate communication in a structured and efficient manner.

In the context of web development, a protocol stack is used to enable communication between different components involved in serving and accessing web content, such as web browsers, web servers, and other network devices. The most common protocol stack used in web development is the TCP/IP protocol stack, which consists of several layers:

1. Application Layer: This is the top layer of the stack and is responsible for providing application-specific services. In web development, this layer includes protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which are used for requesting and serving web pages, data, and resources.
2. Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and data transfer between devices. The most commonly used protocol in this layer is TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data.
3. Internet Layer: The internet layer handles routing and addressing of data packets across different networks. The IP (Internet Protocol) is the primary protocol in this layer, and it is used to identify and locate devices on the network.
4. Link Layer: The lowest layer deals with the physical connection and transmission of data between devices within the same local network. It includes protocols that manage things like network topology, data framing, and error detection.

Web development involves the interaction of various protocols in the protocol stack. For example, when a user enters a URL in a web browser and hits Enter, the browser initiates an HTTP or HTTPS request to a web server. The request travels through the layers of the protocol stack, being encapsulated at each layer with the necessary information for routing and communication. Once the request reaches the web server, it is processed, and the server sends back an HTTP response, which again travels through the layers of the protocol stack to reach the user's browser, ultimately rendering the web page.

In summary, a protocol stack in web development is a layered arrangement of communication protocols that enable the exchange of data and information between different components of the web ecosystem, ensuring reliable, efficient, and structured communication.

#### Q2 What are the different types of web servers, and how do they differ in terms of functionality and performance?

##### Answer :

The different type of servers are:

1. Application servers: Application server is a server which is used to host the application. Application server are system software upon which web application or desktop applications run. It consists of web server connector, computer programming language, database connector, runtime libraries and the Administration code. Application server frameworks are Software framework for building application server. It allows users to create both web application and server environment.
2. Client servers: Client server is a distributed application that partition task or workload between the providers of resource or service called servers and service requesters are called as client Both clients and server communicate with each other over computer network on separate software hardware, but both client and server by reside in the system. Client does not share any of its resources but request resources from server
3. Collaboration Servers: The goal of collaboration server is to support conduct of shared activities of software development teams. Its main concern is to support project management activities rather than project products. Collaboration server provide scheduling support for each project, team or individual. Also provides alerts for schedule reviews and collaboration event.
4. Mail Servers: Mail server is server that handles and delivers email over a network, usually over the internet. It receives email from client computers and deliver them to other mail server. It also delivers email to client computers. Client computer is normal computer where user read their emails for examples computer at home or office. Also advanced mobile or smartphones with email facilities are considered client computers.
5. FTP Servers: FTP server is used for transferring files supporting sub directories, log in and set of manipulation commands. It can also be used to upload HTML pages on HTTP server or download log files to remote PC. Access control interface allows users to start or stop FTP server and to manage the built-in user accounts. It uses user callback function to send the notification about FTP server to user application.
6. Proxy Servers: Proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary for request from clients seeking resources from servers that provide those resources. Proxy server functions behalf of the client when requesting service, potentially masking the true origin of the request to the resource server. Proxy server are used as content control software, to filter the encrypted data, logging, and eavesdropping, repairing errors, accessing services, cross-domain resources, security, etc.
7. Telnet Servers: Telnet server is an application protocol used to provide bidirectional interactive text orientated communication service using virtual terminal connection over internet. Telnet client application are available for virtually all computer platforms. On remote host, telnet server provides access to the command-line interface. Using TCP, user data and telnet control information is transferred on data connection.
8. Real Time Communication Server: Real time communication server is also known as chat server or IRC server. It refers to instant messaging servers. Real time communication server allows large number of users to exchange the information near instantaneously. For example, call over mobile phone or landline, instant messaging like WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Live tv news, video calls, etc.
9. Open Source Servers: Open source server is a public domain software designed to deliver web pages over www. It runs on computers that is connected to the internet. Open source servers support file uploading and downloading using FTP, provides security features. It also supports other communication protocols.
10. Web Server: Web server is a computer software and underlying hardware that Accept request through HTTP. HTTP is a network protocol which is used to distribute the web pages. Using HTTP web browser send request to the server and initiate the communication. Then web server responds with the resources or content or error message. web server also accepts and store the resources sent from the user agent.
11. Virtual Servers: Virtual server is a server that is located in an offsite data center and its resources are shared by multiple users who have control over it. In other words, we can say that virtual server converts one physical server into multiple virtual machine where each can run their operating systems. Virtual servers are a more efficient use of power and can increase a serverâ€™s utilization from the typical 15 percent to as much as 80 percent. They are used for variety of applications from remote file access to web design and development.
